# Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning in Keras with State of the Art Pre Trained Networks:
This Repository contains the implementation of Transfer-Learning and Fine-Tuning solution for classification problems. Transfer learning generally refers to a process where a model trained on one problem is used in some way on a second related problem. It is a popular method in computer vision domain because it allows us to build accurate models in a timesaving way (Rawat & Wang 2017). With Transfer learning, instead of starting the learning from scratch, we start from patterns that have already been learnt while solving a different but related problem. This way we leverage previous learnings and avoid learning from scratch.

## Transfer Learning Process Explained:

### 1. Select a pre-trained model:
From the wide range of pre-trained models that are available, you pick one that looks suitable for your problem. For example, if you’re using Keras, you immediately have access to a set of models, such as VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman 2014), InceptionV3 (Szegedy et al. 2015), and ResNet5 (He et al. 2015). [Here](https://keras.io/applications/) you can see all the models available on Keras.

### 2. Classify your problem according to the Size-Similarity Matrix:
In [Figure: 1]() you have ‘The Matrix’ that controls your choices. This matrix classifies your computer vision problem considering the size of your dataset and its similarity to the dataset in which your pre-trained model was trained. As a rule of thumb, consider that your dataset is small if it has less than 1000 images per class. Regarding dataset similarity, let common sense prevail. For example, if your task is to identify cats and dogs, ImageNet would be a similar dataset because it has images of cats and dogs. However, if your task is to identify cancer cells, ImageNet can’t be considered a similar dataset.

### 3. Fine-tune your model:
Here you can use the Size-Similarity Matrix to guide your choice and then refer to the three options we mentioned before about repurposing a pre-trained model. Figure 4 provides a visual summary of the text that follows.

##### Quadrant 1
Large dataset, but different from the pre-trained model’s dataset. This situation will lead you to Strategy 1. Since you have a large dataset, you’re able to train a model from scratch and do whatever you want. Despite the dataset dissimilarity, in practice, it can still be useful to initialise your model from a pre-trained model, using its architecture and weights.
##### Quadrant 2.
Large dataset and similar to the pre-trained model’s dataset. Here you’re in la-la land. Any option works. Probably, the most efficient option is Strategy 2. Since we have a large dataset, overfitting shouldn’t be an issue, so we can learn as much as we want. However, since the datasets are similar, we can save ourselves from a huge training effort by leveraging previous knowledge. Therefore, it should be enough to train the classifier and the top layers of the convolutional base.
##### Quadrant 3.
Small dataset and different from the pre-trained model’s dataset. This is the 2–7 off-suit hand of computer vision problems. Everything is against you. If complaining is not an option, the only hope you have is Strategy 2. It will be hard to find a balance between the number of layers to train and freeze. If you go to deep your model can overfit, if you stay in the shallow end of your model you won’t learn anything useful. Probably, you’ll need to go deeper than in Quadrant 2 and you’ll need to consider data augmentation techniques (a nice summary on data augmentation techniques is provided here).
##### Quadrant 4.
Small dataset, but similar to the pre-trained model’s dataset. I asked Master Yoda about this one he told me that ‘be the best option, Strategy 3 should’. I don’t know about you, but I don’t underestimate the Force. Accordingly, go for Strategy 3. You just need to remove the last fully-connected layer (output layer), run the pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor, and then use the resulting features to train a new classifier.
