### Transfer Learning:
Transfer learning refers to a process where a model trained on one problem is used in some way on a second related problem. It is a popular method in Computer-Vision domain because it allows us to build effecient models in a time-saving way (Rawat & Wang 2017). With Transfer learning, instead of learning the model from scratch, we start from patterns that have already been learnt while solving a different but related problem. This way we leverage previous learnings and avoid learning from scratch.

### Transfer Learning Strategies:
When weâ€™re reusing a pre-trained model for our own needs, we start by removing the original classifier, then we add a new classifier that fits our purposes, and finally we have to fine-tune our model according to one of the three listed strategies.

### Transfer Learning Process:

#### 1. Select a pre-trained model:
From the wide range of available pre-trained models at [Here](https://keras.io/applications/), we have to pick one that looks suitable for our problem.
#### 2. Classify the problem and Fine-Tune the Model according to the Size-Similarity Matrix:
In [Figure: 2](#size-similarity-matrix-and-decision-map) we have **The Size-Similarity Matrix** that controls our choices. This matrix classifies the Computer-Vision problem considering the size of the dataset and its similarity to the dataset in which pre-trained model is to be trained.

   + Large data and diff from pretrained dataset (train entire model)
   + Large data and same as pretrained dataset (train some layers and freeze others)
   + Small data and diff from pretrained dataset (train some layers and freeze others)
   + Small data and same as pretrained dataset (freeze the conv base)
